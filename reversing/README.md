# Reverse Engineering

These challenges usually provide Linux ELF executables or Windows EXEs and require some reverse engineering to pull some info out in a more human readable format.

Our goal for FrecklesCon CTF is to use these to teach topics related to:
- Tool basics (ghidra, radare2, etc)
- Executable file structures
