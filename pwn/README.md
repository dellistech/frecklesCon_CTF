# Binary Exploitation

These challenges are mostly Linux ELF executables or Windows EXEs with intentional vulnerabilities added. Our goal for FrecklesCon CTF is to use these to teach topics related to:
- ASM Basics (Registers, The Stack, the GOT, etc)
- Buffer Overflow basics
- ROP
- Basic Binary Security (Canaries, ASLR, NX memory, etc)
